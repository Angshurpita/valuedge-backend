ValuEdge Pro Backend is a FastAPI-based financial valuation engine that performs institutional-style analyses including Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), sensitivity analysis, and comparable company valuation. It exposes a clean REST API consumed by a React frontend, handles all financial computations server-side using NumPy and Pandas, and supports automated PDF report generation. The service is deployed on Render and designed to be stateless, production-ready, and easily extensible for features like authentication, persistence, or rate limiting.
